# homados

Signal should be simple.

Version 0.0.3
</br></br></br>

## Info

homados is a software tool for generating all different kinds of sounds -- tonal, noisy, you name
it. This is the third public version, containing many known issues and is still very early on in
the roadmap. I'd love to hear feedback so I can steer this thing in a useful direction and make
this software as useful and excellent as it can be.

There is a manual for this software including information on how to use it, what's included,
references, and acknowledgements. I will update this README, too, to include a more concise form
of some of that.

Enjoy!

## Known Issues, Roadmap, Housekeeping

### Known Issues / Housekeeping

- Some tonal oscillators are prone to aliasing artifacts. Working on this.
- Multichannel behavior is loose, and frequently unpredictable
  
### Roadmap

- Better testing on windows platform
- A few more standard noise types, namely burst and true OVN
- More predictable and defined multichannel behavior
- output normalization
- other stuff but I'm not tellin'
