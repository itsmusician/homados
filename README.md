# homados

awesome software tagline in progress!

Version 0.0.1
</br></br></br>

## Info

homados is a software tool for generating all different kinds of sounds -- tonal, noisy, you name
it. This is the first public version, containing many known issues and is still very early on in
the roadmap. I'd love to hear feedback so I can steer this thing in a useful direction and make
this software as useful and excellent as it can be.

There is a manual for this software including information on how to use it, what's included,
references, and acknowledgements. I will update this README, too, to include a more concise form
of some of that.

If you're seeing this thanks for being one of early ones. That's really cool of you.

Enjoy!

## Known Issues, Roadmap, Housekeeping

### Known Issues / Housekeeping

- Sweeps are included in code but disabled until cleaner implementations may be made
- Multichannel behavior is loose, and frequently unpredictable
- The tonal oscillators are a little noisy, see roadmap for planned fix
  
### Roadmap

- Phase Accumulator versions of oscillators for cleaner tones and useable sweeps
- A few more standard noise types, namely burst and true OVN
- More predictable and defined multichannel behavior
- dBFS units as an optional alternative to pure amplitude values for the gain scalar
- output normalization
- Pulse-Width generator
- Single argument for filepath + file name
- Signal time offset
- More options in the debug script
- other stuff but I'm not tellin'
